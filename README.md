**Let AI build your Home Assistant automations – or act as your DevOps for the ones you write by hand. Just describe what you need in natural language. 🏠🤖**

You describe your goal → AI inspects your Home Assistant → designs a custom solution → and deploys it on-board automatically. 🚀

And if you prefer to handcraft your automations and scripts yourself, the agent can simply act as your DevOps and extra pair of hands: quickly uploading your changes, running tests, and analyzing logs on demand. **You stay in control and decide how much you delegate to AI and how deep it should go.**

Transform the way you manage your smart home. This add-on enables **Cursor**, **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, or any **MCP-enabled IDE** to:

- 📝 Analyze your Home Assistant configuration, entities, and devices  
- 🏗️ Create intelligent automations, scripts, and complete systems — including Home Assistant helpers that can be fully managed programmatically  
- 🎨 Design and customize Lovelace dashboards with full control over cards, layouts, and styling  
- 🖌️ Create and tweak themes for a personalized UI  
- 🔄 Safely deploy changes with automatic Git-based versioning  
- 🔍 Monitor and troubleshoot your setup through log analysis  
- 📦 Install and manage HACS integrations and custom repositories  

No more manual YAML editing or searching through documentation - just describe what you want in natural language!

**Real example:** User says *"Install smart climate control"* → AI analyzes 7 TRVs, creates 10 automations + 9 helpers + 10 sensors + 5 scripts, deploys everything, and it just works!

## 🎯 What is this?

**HA Vibecode Agent** is a Home Assistant add-on that exposes a safe on-board REST API and toolset, allowing AI assistants (Cursor, VS Code, Claude, Continue, and any MCP-enabled IDE) to work *with* your Home Assistant instead of just generating YAML in the dark.

---

### 🔍 Analyze your setup

✅ Read your full configuration — entities, automations, scripts, helpers  
✅ Understand your devices — capabilities, relations, and usage patterns  
✅ Learn existing logic — analyze how your current automations and scripts behave  

---

### 🏗️ Build intelligence

✅ Create complete systems — multiple interconnected automations in seconds  
✅ Generate helpers and sensors — tailored to your actual setup and needs  
✅ Write optimized scripts — based on real entities, areas, and devices  
✅ Refactor existing logic — improve or merge automations instead of starting from scratch  

---

### 📊 Dashboards & UI

✅ Create and update Lovelace dashboards — fully programmatically  
✅ Add, remove, or rearrange cards — stat, graphs, history, custom cards, and more  
✅ Control layouts and views — organize rooms, areas, and scenarios  
✅ Design and tweak themes — colors, typography, and styles for a personalized UI  

---

### 🔒 Safe operations

✅ Git-based versioning — every change is tracked with meaningful commit messages  
✅ Human-readable commits — AI explains *what* changed and *why*  
✅ Configuration validation — test before apply to reduce breaking changes  
✅ One-click rollback — revert to a previous state if something goes wrong  
✅ Activity log — full audit trail of what the agent did and when  

---

### 📦 Extend with the community

✅ Install and configure HACS — unlock 1000+ community integrations  
✅ Search repositories — themes, plugins, custom components, dashboards  
✅ Install integrations — one-command setup for new HACS components  
✅ Keep things fresh — update all HACS repositories from a single place  

---

**Result:**  
You describe your goal → AI inspects your Home Assistant → designs a custom solution → and deploys it on-board automatically. 🚀


### 🚀 How is this different from other MCP modules for Home Assistant?

Most MCP integrations I’ve seen for Cursor, VS Code or Claude work only on your local machine and talk to Home Assistant over SSH and sometimes the REST API.

For serious Home Assistant work, that’s not really enough:

Home Assistant is not just a bunch of YAML files.
It exposes multiple internal APIs, and some of the most important ones are only available from inside HA itself over the WebSocket API.

When you access HA only via SSH, the AI usually has to generate and upload a helper script on every request, then execute it blindly on the host.
Since that script can be different every time, each request is a bit of a black box — more like playing Russian roulette than doing reliable automation.

Because of that, I chose a different architecture.

This project is **split into two modules**:

**Home Assistant Agent** (this module) – runs inside Home Assistant (as an add-on),
has native access to all relevant APIs, files and services,
and exposes a safe, well-defined interface for external tools.

**Home Assistant MCP server** – runs on your computer alongside your AI IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
and talks to the Agent over a controlled API instead of SSH hacks (installation steps below)

This design makes working with Home Assistant faster, more predictable, safer and repeatable.
Your AI IDE gets exactly the actions and data it needs — through a stable API — instead of constantly inventing ad-hoc scripts and hoping they behave correctly.

  - Examples: "Add automation: Control lights when motion detected", "Update theme: Change primary color to blue"
  - Messages are generated based on operation context and user-provided descriptions
- Stores up to 30 commits (configurable via `max_backups`)
- Automatic cleanup: When reaching max commits, keeps last 20 commits (maintains buffer)
- Commit messages include operation details and context

### File Operations

- All paths are relative to `/config`
- Cannot access files outside config directory
- Automatic backup before write/delete
- YAML validation on parse

### Service Calls

- Full access to Home Assistant API
- Can call any service (lights, climate, system, etc.)
- Requires proper entity IDs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "spawn npx ENOENT" error (Cursor / VS Code / Other IDE Console)

This error means Node.js is not installed or not found in your system PATH.

Solution: Install Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher) on the computer where Cursor is running:

Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org
Restart Cursor completely after installation
Verify installation by running node --version in a terminal
Important: Node.js must be installed on your computer (where Cursor runs), not on the Home Assistant server.


### Add-on won't start

**Check logs:** Supervisor → HA Vibecode Agent → Logs

Common issues:
- Port 8099 already in use
- Invalid configuration
- Missing permissions

### API returns 401 Unauthorized

- Check Agent Key is correct
- Regenerate key if needed: Settings → Add-ons → HA Vibecode Agent → Open Web UI
- Ensure Authorization header is present
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AGENT_KEY`

### File operations fail

- Check file paths are relative to `/config`
- Ensure files exist for read/delete operations
- Check YAML syntax for parse errors

### Git versioning not working

- Check `enable_git_versioning` is `true`
- View logs for Git errors
- Ensure `/config` is writable
