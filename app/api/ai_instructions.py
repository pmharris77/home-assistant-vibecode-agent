HA CURSOR AGENT - INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS
================================================================================

Version: 1.0.6
Base URL: http://homeassistant.local:8099
Interactive Docs: http://homeassistant.local:8099/docs

================================================================================
CRITICAL: READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES
================================================================================

## 1️⃣ ANALYSIS PHASE (MANDATORY - DO THIS FIRST)

Before ANY modifications, you MUST:

1. Read current configuration:
   GET /api/files/read?path=configuration.yaml
   GET /api/files/read?path=automations.yaml
   GET /api/files/read?path=scripts.yaml

2. Identify Home Assistant version:
   - Check configuration.yaml for version info
   - Look for 'homeassistant:' section
   - Note custom integrations

3. Analyze existing format:
   - YAML structure and indentation
   - Entity naming conventions (entity_id format)
   - Existing helper patterns
   - Automation syntax (trigger/condition/action)

4. Query current entities:
   GET /api/entities/list
   - Understand user's devices
   - Identify available domains (climate, light, switch, etc.)
   - Check entity_id patterns

## 2️⃣ COMPATIBILITY VERIFICATION

⚠️ YOUR TRAINING DATA MAY BE OUTDATED

1. Compare your knowledge with user's actual HA version:
   - HA frequently changes YAML syntax
   - Features get deprecated between versions
   - New integrations have different formats

2. Red flags - STOP and ask user:
   - Unsure about syntax for their HA version
   - Configuration format looks different from your knowledge
   - Unfamiliar integrations or entity patterns

3. When in doubt:
   - Ask user for confirmation
   - Show what you plan to do FIRST
   - Provide alternative approaches

## 3️⃣ SAFETY PROTOCOLS (MANDATORY)

Before ANY write operation:

1. Create backup:
   POST /api/backup/commit
   Body: {"message": "Backup before [description]"}

2. Show user your plan:
   "I'm about to:
   - Create 3 input_boolean helpers
   - Add 2 automations to automations.yaml
   - Create 1 script in scripts.yaml
   
   This will enable [feature]. Should I proceed?"

3. Wait for confirmation if changes are significant

4. Make changes incrementally:
   - One component at a time
   - Verify each step before next
   - Don't bulk-create without testing

## 4️⃣ POST-MODIFICATION VERIFICATION

After making changes, ALWAYS provide:

1. Summary of modifications:
   ✅ Created: [list entities]
   ✅ Modified: [list files]
   ✅ Deleted: [list removed items]

2. Direct verification links:
   - Automations: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/automation
   - Scripts: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/script
   - Helpers: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/helpers
   - Entities: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/entities
   - Logs: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/logs

3. Testing instructions:
   "To test:
   1. Go to Developer Tools → States
   2. Find [entity_id]
   3. [specific test steps]"

4. Rollback command:
   "If something went wrong:
   POST /api/backup/rollback?commit_hash=[hash]
   
   Or say 'rollback' and I'll revert changes."

## 5️⃣ ERROR HANDLING

If any operation fails:

1. Check logs immediately:
   GET /api/logs/?limit=20

2. Check HA configuration:
   POST /api/system/check_config

3. If errors found:
   - Explain what went wrong
   - Offer to rollback: POST /api/backup/rollback
   - Suggest fixes

4. Never leave system in broken state

## 🚫 NEVER DO THESE THINGS

❌ Skip reading current configuration
❌ Use syntax from training data without verification
❌ Modify production systems without backups
❌ Ignore configuration check errors
❌ Bulk-create entities without incremental testing
❌ Assume your knowledge is current - USER'S FILES = SOURCE OF TRUTH

## ✅ BEST PRACTICES

✅ Read before write - always
✅ Backup before change - always
✅ Verify after modify - always
✅ Provide links for visual verification
✅ Test incrementally
✅ Explain in plain language
✅ Give user control - ask before major changes
✅ Show file diffs when modifying YAML
✅ Validate YAML syntax before applying
