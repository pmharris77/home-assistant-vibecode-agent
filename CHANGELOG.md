# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.9.5] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion for Restored Entities

**Added support for deleting restored helpers via entity registry**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added entity registry deletion for restored entities
- ✅ Handles helpers with `restored: true` attribute
- ✅ Uses `config/entity_registry/remove` API for cleanup
- ✅ Supports deletion of helpers that were removed from config but still exist in database

**Use Cases:**
- Delete helpers that were removed from YAML but restored by Home Assistant
- Clean up orphaned entities from entity registry
- Complete cleanup of obsolete helpers

## [2.9.4] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion Logic

**Enhanced config entry deletion with multiple matching strategies**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Improved config entry search with multiple matching strategies:
  - Match by title (common for UI-created helpers)
  - Match by entity_id in options
  - Match by entry details (deep search)
- ✅ Added debug logging for config entry search process
- ✅ Better error messages when helper exists but can't be deleted
- ✅ More robust handling of config-entry-based helpers

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `config/config_entries/get` API to get detailed entry information
- Tries multiple matching strategies before giving up
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

## [2.9.3] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion

**Enhanced helper deletion to support config entry helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ `DELETE /api/helpers/delete/{entity_id}` now attempts to delete helpers created via UI/API (config entries)
- ✅ First tries YAML deletion (if helper exists in YAML)
- ✅ Then tries config entry deletion (if helper was created via UI/API)
- ✅ Better error messages when helper cannot be deleted automatically

**Use Cases:**
- Delete helpers created via `ha_create_helper` MCP tool
- Delete helpers created manually via Home Assistant UI
- Clean up obsolete helpers from configuration

## [2.9.2] - 2025-11-18

### ✨ NEW: Service Call API Endpoint

**Added API endpoint for calling Home Assistant services**

**New Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/entities/call_service` - Call any Home Assistant service

**Features:**
- ✅ Call any Home Assistant service via REST API
- ✅ Support for service_data and target parameters
- ✅ Proper parameter merging (target fields merged into service_data)
- ✅ Full error handling and logging

**Parameters:**
- `domain` (required) - Service domain (e.g., "number", "light", "climate")
- `service` (required) - Service name (e.g., "set_value", "turn_on", "set_temperature")
- `service_data` (optional) - Service-specific data
- `target` (optional) - Target entity/entities

**Examples:**
```json
// Set number value
{
  "domain": "number",
  "service": "set_value",
  "service_data": {
    "entity_id": "number.alex_trv_local_temperature_offset",
    "value": -2.0
  }
}

// Turn on light
{
  "domain": "light",
  "service": "turn_on",
  "target": {"entity_id": "light.living_room"}
}

// Set climate temperature
{
  "domain": "climate",
  "service": "set_temperature",
  "target": {"entity_id": "climate.bedroom_trv_thermostat"},
  "service_data": {"temperature": 21.0}
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Configure device parameters (TRV offsets, limits, etc.)
- Control devices (lights, switches, climate)
- Update helper values
- Any Home Assistant service call

**Integration:**
- Used by MCP tool `ha_call_service`
- Enables AI to call services directly
- Full integration with existing ha_client.call_service method

## [2.9.1] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 FIX: Separate YAML files for each helper type

**Problem in v2.9.0:**
- All helper domains (input_boolean, input_text, etc.) referenced same file `helpers.yaml`
- This caused conflicts - each domain tried to load entire file
- Helpers not appearing after reload

**Solution:**
- Each domain now has its own file:
  - `input_boolean.yaml`
  - `input_text.yaml`
  - `input_number.yaml`
  - `input_datetime.yaml`
  - `input_select.yaml`
- Clean configuration.yaml references:
  ```yaml
  input_boolean: !include input_boolean.yaml
  input_text: !include input_text.yaml
  # ... etc
  ```

**Now helpers ACTUALLY work!** 🎉

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-11

### 🎉 MAJOR: Helper Creation via YAML Now Works!

**Breaking Discovery:** Helpers CAN be created via API using YAML + reload method!

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Write helper config to `helpers.yaml`
- ✅ Automatically include `helpers.yaml` in `configuration.yaml`
- ✅ Call `input_*.reload` service to apply changes
- ✅ Helper appears immediately without HA restart

**New Method:**
```python
# 1. Add to helpers.yaml:
input_boolean:
  my_switch:
    name: "My Switch"
    icon: "mdi:toggle-switch"

# 2. Reload integration:
await ws_client.call_service('input_boolean', 'reload', {})

# 3. Helper is now available!
```

**API Changes:**
- ✅ `POST /api/helpers/create` - NOW WORKS via YAML method
- ✅ `DELETE /api/helpers/delete/{entity_id}` - NOW WORKS via YAML method
- ✅ Automatic entity_id generation from name
- ✅ Git commits for all helper changes
- ✅ Validation and error handling

**What Changed:**
- Moved from `.storage/` approach (doesn't work) to YAML approach (works!)
- Helpers created via API are now YAML-based (editable in UI and files)
- Full CRUD support for all helper types

**Credit:** Solution discovered via Home Assistant Community forums

## [2.7.7] - 2025-11-11

### 🚨 Critical: Added Explicit Ban on `attribute:` in Conditional Cards

**MAJOR UPDATE: Found and fixed critical mistake pattern in AI instructions**

**The Problem:**
AI was generating invalid conditional cards with `attribute:` key:
```yaml
# ❌ This was being generated (DOES NOT WORK!)
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: climate.office_trv
    attribute: hvac_action    # ← Lovelace does NOT support this!
    state: heating
```

**Root Cause:**
- Lovelace conditional cards do NOT support `attribute:` key
- Home Assistant automations DO support `attribute:` (confusion!)
- AI instructions didn't explicitly forbid this pattern

**What Was Added:**

1. **🚨 CRITICAL warning section** at document start
2. **Expanded Mistake #4** with multiple wrong examples
3. **Updated Golden Rules** - moved `attribute:` ban to #1
4. **Explanation of automation vs dashboard syntax difference**

**New Structure:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Use template sensor
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Office TRV HVAC Action"
        state: "{{ state_attr('climate.xxx', 'hvac_action') }}"

# Then in dashboard:
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: sensor.office_trv_hvac_action
    state: heating
```

**Impact:**
- AI will never use `attribute:` in Lovelace conditionals
- Clear explanation why (automation vs dashboard difference)
- Template sensor pattern shown as solution
- Fixed actual broken dashboard in Home Assistant (commit 3bee434b)

**Files Updated:**
- `06_conditional_cards.md` - Added explicit ban and examples
- Home Assistant `heating-now.yaml` - Fixed all 7 TRV conditionals

**Version:** 2.7.7 (PATCH - critical documentation fix)

## [2.7.6] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 Fix: Conditional Cards Guide - Corrected Structure

**Fixed incorrect conditional card patterns in AI instructions**

**What was wrong in v2.7.5:**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Missing "condition: state"
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: climate.office_trv
    state: "heat"
```

**Corrected in v2.7.6:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Must include "condition: state"
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: sensor.office_trv_hvac_action
    state: heating
```

**Key fixes:**
1. ✅ Added `condition: state` requirement (most common mistake!)
2. ✅ Corrected to use template sensors for hvac_action attributes
3. ✅ Fixed state value: `heating` not "heat"
4. ✅ Added `condition: numeric_state` for numeric comparisons
5. ✅ Updated all examples with correct structure
6. ✅ Based on actual working commit: e8ed8a3b

**Reference:** Commit e8ed8a3b - "Before deleting dashboard: heating-now.yaml" (the working version)

**Impact:**
- AI will now generate correct conditional cards
- Prevents common YAML structure mistakes
- Template sensors properly documented
- Real-world tested patterns

**Version:** 2.7.6 (PATCH - documentation fix)

**Version:** 2.7.5 (PATCH - documentation enhancement)

## [2.7.4] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Git Rollback Endpoint

**Fixed 404 error when rolling back via MCP tools**

**Bug:**
- MCP calls: `POST /api/backup/rollback/{commit_hash}` (path param)
- API expected: `POST /api/backup/rollback` + body
- Result: 404 Not Found

**Fix:**
- Added path parameter endpoint: `/rollback/{commit_hash}`
- Kept body parameter endpoint for compatibility
- Both versions now work

**API Endpoints:**
```
✅ POST /api/backup/rollback/abc123 (path param - for MCP)
✅ POST /api/backup/rollback + body (legacy - for direct API calls)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Git rollback works from AI
- ✅ Can restore previous configurations
- ✅ Both calling styles supported

**Version:** 2.7.4 (PATCH - bug fix)

## [2.7.3] - 2025-11-10

### ✨ Feature: Dashboard Validation + Detailed Errors

**Comprehensive dashboard validation and better error reporting!**

**Part 1: Dashboard Filename Validation**
- Validates filename contains hyphen (HA requirement)
- Checks for spaces, uppercase
- Returns helpful suggestions
- Prevents common mistakes

**Validation Rules:**
```
❌ BAD:  "heating", "stat", "climate" (no hyphen)
✅ GOOD: "heating-now", "climate-control"

Auto-suggestions:
"stat" → "stat-dashboard"
"Heating Now" → "heating-now" (kebab-case)
```

**Part 2: Pre-Creation Checks**
- AI checks if dashboard already exists
- Warns before overwriting
- Validates filename before backup (fail fast)

**Part 3: Detailed Configuration Errors**
- check_config returns detailed errors like Developer Tools
- Shows line numbers and specific issues
- Extracts error messages from HA API
- Much better debugging

**AI Instructions Updated:**
- Added STEP 0: Pre-Creation Checks (mandatory)
- Dashboard name validation rules
- Examples and auto-conversion logic

**Before:**
```
Error: "Configuration has errors: 500 Server Error"
```

**After:**
```
Error: "Configuration invalid!

Invalid config for 'lovelace' at configuration.yaml, line 342: 
Url path needs to contain a hyphen (-) for dictionary value..."
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents invalid dashboard names
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ AI can understand and fix issues
- ✅ Fewer failed dashboard creations

**Version:** 2.7.3 (PATCH - validation improvements)

## [2.7.2] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix: File List Root Directory

**Fixed 500 error when listing files with directory='/'**

**Bug:**
- `ha_list_files` with directory="/" failed
- Error: "Path outside config directory: /"
- AI couldn't browse config directory

**Root Cause:**
- _get_full_path() treated "/" as absolute path
- Security check failed

**Fix:**
- Handle "/" and "" as root config directory
- Strip leading slashes from paths
- Return config_path directly for root

**Impact:**
- ✅ AI can now browse config directory
- ✅ ha_list_files works correctly
- ✅ Security still enforced

**Version:** 2.7.2 (PATCH - bug fix)

## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-10

- `/store` returns COMPLETE catalog (83+ add-ons)
- Enables AI to recommend from full catalog

**Use cases:**
- AI can show all available add-ons
- AI can recommend based on user needs
- Complete catalog browsing

**Changes:**
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: added list_store_addons()
- app/api/addons.py: added GET /store endpoint

## [2.3.14] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Repository Parsing Logic (Complete Fix):**
- ✅ Fixed parsing error for all Supervisor API response formats
- ✅ Handles 4 different response formats correctly
- ✅ No more `'list' object has no attribute 'get'` errors

**Root cause found:**
- Supervisor API returns: `{'data': [...list...]}`
- Old code: `result.get('data', {}).get('repositories')`
- If `data` is list: `[...].get('repositories')` → ERROR!

**Complete fix - handles all formats:**
1. Direct list: `[...]`
2. Dict with repositories: `{'repositories': [...]}`
3. Dict with data as list: `{'data': [...]}`
4. Dict with nested data: `{'data': {'repositories': [...]}}`

**Impact:**
- Repository management now fully functional
- All Supervisor API response formats handled correctly

## [2.3.13] - 2025-11-09

### 🔍 Feature: MCP Client Version Tracking

**Added MCP version logging:**
- ✅ Middleware logs MCP client version on first request
- ✅ Reads X-MCP-Client-Version header from MCP client
- ✅ Shows: `🔌 MCP Client connected: v2.3.4 from 192.168.68.63`
- ✅ Logs once per client IP (avoids spam)

**Benefits:**
- See which MCP version is connecting
- Identify version mismatches
- Better debugging capabilities

## [2.3.12] - 2025-11-09

### 🔧 Maintenance

**Force Docker rebuild:**
- Version increment to trigger Home Assistant rebuild
- Ensures repository parsing fix is applied

## [2.3.11] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Repository List Parsing:**
- ✅ Fixed parsing error: `'list' object has no attribute 'get'`
- ✅ Added flexible parsing for Supervisor API response
- ✅ Handles both list and dict response formats

**What was wrong:**
- Code assumed: `result.get('data', {}).get('repositories', [])`
- Supervisor API may return list directly or in different structure
- Caused error when listing repositories

**Fix:**
- Check if result is list → use directly
- Check if result is dict → handle multiple formats
- Fallback to empty list if unexpected format

**Impact:**
- `/api/addons/repositories` now works correctly
- AI can check connected repositories
- AI can suggest adding community repositories

**Changes:**
- app/api/addons.py: flexible parsing in list_repositories()

## [2.3.10] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Installed Add-ons Detection Logic:**
- ✅ Changed detection from `a.get('installed')` to `a.get('version')`
- ✅ Supervisor API returns `version` field for installed add-ons
- ✅ Field `installed` is not always present in response

**What was wrong:**
- Logic checked for `installed` field: `if a.get('installed')`
- Supervisor API doesn't always include this field
- Installed add-ons have `version` field (current installed version)
- Available (not installed) add-ons only have `version_latest`

**Impact:**
- `/api/addons/available` now correctly separates installed vs available
- `/api/addons/installed` now shows actual installed add-ons
- AI can see which add-ons are already installed

**Changes:**
- app/api/addons.py: changed filter logic in both endpoints
  - `list_available_addons()`: uses `version` to detect installed
  - `list_installed_addons()`: uses `version` to detect installed

## [2.3.9] - 2025-11-09

### 📚 Enhanced AI Instructions

**Improved Add-on Management Guidance:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive add-on reference guide with purpose and use cases
- ✅ Explained why popular add-ons may not appear (minimal repository setup)
- ✅ Removed hardcoded slugs - now dynamically searches add-ons by name
- ✅ Added instructions for users to add community repositories
- ✅ Detailed descriptions of popular add-ons:
  - Mosquitto MQTT Broker (IoT communication)
  - Zigbee2MQTT (Zigbee devices)
  - Node-RED (visual automation)
  - ESPHome (DIY devices)
  - Terminal & SSH (system access)
  - MariaDB (database)
  - DuckDNS/Let's Encrypt (remote access)

**New Use Cases:**
- "What add-ons do you recommend?" - AI suggests based on user needs
- "Why do I see so few add-ons?" - AI explains minimal installation
- Dynamic slug discovery instead of hardcoded values

**Impact:**
- AI can now provide intelligent recommendations
- Users understand why certain add-ons aren't visible
- Better guidance for repository management
- Safer installations (no hardcoded slugs that may be wrong)

**Changes:**
- app/api/ai_instructions.py: 2.3.0 → 2.3.9
- Added 📋 Popular Add-ons Reference
- Added 🎯 Use Case templates
- Added ⚠️ Repository requirements explanation

## [2.3.8] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Fixed Supervisor API URL Path Duplication:**
- ✅ Removed `/supervisor/` prefix from all endpoint paths
- ✅ Fixed URL from `http://supervisor/supervisor/addons` to `http://supervisor/addons`
- ✅ All add-on management endpoints now use correct URL format

**Root cause:**
- v2.3.4 added `/supervisor/` prefix to endpoints
- But `base_url` is already `http://supervisor`
- Result: `http://supervisor` + `/supervisor/addons` = double `/supervisor/` → 404

**Fixed all endpoints:**
- `addons` (not `supervisor/addons`)
- `addons/{slug}/info`, `/logs`, `/install`, `/uninstall`, etc.
- `store/repositories` (not `supervisor/store/repositories`)

**Impact:**
- 🎉 Add-on management should now work with correct URLs!
- Manager role from v2.3.7 + correct URLs = working add-on management

## [2.3.7] - 2025-11-09

### 🔐 Critical Fix: Supervisor API Access + Security

**1. Added Supervisor Manager Role (Critical):**
- ✅ Added `hassio_role: manager` to config.yaml
- ✅ Grants add-on permissions to manage other add-ons via Supervisor API
- ✅ Fixes 403 Forbidden errors for all add-on management operations

**Root cause of 403 errors:**
- Supervisor API requires `hassio_role: manager` for add-on management
- Without this role, all Supervisor API calls return 403 Forbidden
- `hassio_api: true` alone is not sufficient for add-on management

**2. Security Fix: Removed Token Logging:**
- ✅ Removed token preview from all logs
- ✅ Changed from `Token: 7e2dec72...` to no token logging
- ✅ Headers logging moved to DEBUG level

**Why:**
- Logging tokens (even preview) is a security risk
- Tokens should never appear in logs accessible to users
- Debug-level logging available if needed for troubleshooting

**Changes:**
- config.yaml: added `hassio_role: manager`
- app/main.py: removed token from SupervisorClient startup log
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: removed token from all logs

**Impact:**
- 🎉 Add-on management should now work correctly!
- 🔐 No token information in logs (improved security)

## [2.3.6] - 2025-11-09

### 🔍 Debug Enhancement

**Enhanced Supervisor API Logging:**
- ✅ Added detailed logging for Supervisor API requests
- ✅ Log exact URL, headers, and token (preview) for each request
- ✅ Added SupervisorClient initialization log in startup event

**Purpose:**
- Debug 403 Forbidden errors from Supervisor API
- Verify correct URL format and authentication headers
- Identify root cause of add-on management issues

**Changes:**
- app/main.py: added SupervisorClient logging in startup event
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: enhanced request logging (INFO level)
- Logs now show: URL, headers, token preview for debugging

## [2.3.5] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**1. Supervisor API Authentication Fix (Critical):**
- ✅ Fixed authentication header for Supervisor API
- ✅ Changed from `Authorization: Bearer {token}` to `X-Supervisor-Token: {token}`
- ✅ All add-on management operations now authenticate correctly

**What was wrong:**
- Supervisor API uses custom `X-Supervisor-Token` header, not standard `Authorization: Bearer`
- All requests were rejected with 403 Forbidden due to incorrect auth header
- Home Assistant Supervisor API documentation specifies `X-Supervisor-Token` format

**Impact:**
- All add-on management endpoints now work correctly ✅
- Authentication passes, full add-on lifecycle management functional
- Fixes 403 Forbidden errors from v2.3.4

**2. Logs Endpoint Redirect Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed unnecessary 307 redirect for `/api/logs` endpoint
- ✅ Changed `@router.get("/")` to `@router.get("")` in logs.py
- ✅ Direct response without redirect

**What was wrong:**
- Endpoint was defined as `/api/logs/` (with trailing slash)
- Requests to `/api/logs` caused 307 redirect to `/api/logs/`
- FastAPI automatically redirects when trailing slash mismatch occurs

**Impact:**
- `/api/logs` now responds directly with 200 OK (no redirect)
- Improved API performance and cleaner request logs

## [2.3.4] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Supervisor API Endpoint Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed all Supervisor API endpoints to use correct `/supervisor/` prefix
- ✅ Changed from `http://supervisor/addons` to `http://supervisor/supervisor/addons`
- ✅ All add-on management operations now work correctly

**What was wrong:**
- All endpoints were missing the `/supervisor/` prefix
- Resulted in 403 Forbidden errors from Supervisor API
- Supervisor API requires: `http://supervisor/supervisor/{endpoint}`

**Fixed endpoints:**
- ✅ `supervisor/addons` (list all)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/info` (get info)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/logs` (get logs)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/install` (install)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/uninstall` (uninstall)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/start` (start)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/stop` (stop)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/restart` (restart)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/update` (update)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/options` (configure)
- ✅ `supervisor/store/repositories` (repositories)

**Impact:**
- All add-on management endpoints now return correct data instead of 403 errors
- Full add-on lifecycle management now functional ✅

## [2.3.3] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Router Prefix Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `/api/addons` prefix in `addons.py`
- ✅ Changed `router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/addons", ...)` to `router = APIRouter()`
- ✅ All add-on management endpoints now work correctly

**What was wrong:**
- Prefix was defined both in `addons.py` AND `main.py`
- URLs became `/api/addons/api/addons/installed` → 404
- Other routers (files, hacs) correctly use no prefix in router definition

**Impact:**
- Fixes all add-on management endpoints returning 404
- `/api/addons/installed` now correctly maps to `/api/addons/installed` ✅

## [2.3.2] - 2025-11-09

### 🔧 Build Fix

**Force Docker Rebuild:**
- ✅ Added version comment to `Dockerfile` to break Docker cache
- ✅ Ensures all new files (addons.py, supervisor_client.py) are included in build
- ✅ Fixes 404 error for add-on management endpoints

**Why this fix:**
- Home Assistant was using cached Docker image from v2.3.0
- New files weren't being copied into the container
- Cache-busting comment forces full rebuild

## [2.3.1] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Critical Import Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed ImportError in `app/api/addons.py`
- ✅ Changed `from app.models import Response` to `from app.models.schemas import Response`
- ✅ Agent now starts correctly

**Impact:**
- Fixes agent startup failure in v2.3.0
- All add-on management features now work correctly

- ✅ Search by name, author, description
- ✅ Install any repository with one command
- ✅ Update all repositories
- ✅ Get detailed repository info (stars, versions, authors)
- ✅ Category filtering (integration, theme, plugin, appdaemon, etc)

**Requirements:**
- HACS must be configured via UI first time (one-time setup)
- WebSocket requires SUPERVISOR_TOKEN (add-on mode)

## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-09

### ✨ NEW: HACS Support (Initial)

**One-Click HACS Installation** - AI can now install HACS!

Added initial HACS API:
- `POST /api/hacs/install` - Download and install HACS from GitHub
- `GET /api/hacs/status` - Check if HACS is installed

**Note:** v2.1.0 only supported installation. v2.2.0 adds full repository management.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed
- **API endpoint naming** - added `/api/system/check-config` endpoint
  - MCP was calling `/check-config` (with dash)
  - Agent only had `/check_config` (with underscore)
  - Now supports both for compatibility
  - Fixes 404 Not Found error when checking configuration

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-08

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES

  - Old configurations with `HA_TOKEN` will **STOP WORKING**
  - Must update to `HA_AGENT_KEY` in mcp.json
  - Cleaner API without legacy code

### Migration Required

**If you're using `HA_TOKEN`:**
```json
// OLD (will not work):
{
  "env": {
    "HA_TOKEN": "your-key"
  }
}

// NEW (required):
{
  "env": {
    "HA_AGENT_KEY": "your-key"
  }
}
```

**How to migrate:**
1. Update add-on to v2.0.0
2. Update MCP to v2.0.0
3. Change `HA_TOKEN` → `HA_AGENT_KEY` in your mcp.json
4. Restart Cursor

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-08

### 🔒 Security & UX Improvements

**Breaking Change:** API authentication changed from Home Assistant Long-Lived Token to dedicated API Key.

### Added
- **Dedicated API Key system** - separate from HA tokens
  - Auto-generates secure API key (32 bytes, cryptographically secure)
  - Optional: set custom API key in add-on configuration
  - Stored in `/config/.ha_cursor_agent_key`
- **Ingress Panel** - beautiful web UI in Home Assistant sidebar
  - Shows current API key (masked by default, click to reveal)
  - Copy to clipboard button
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Direct links to documentation
- **Optional notifications** - get notified when API key is generated
  - Configurable in add-on settings

### Changed
- **Authentication simplified** - no need to create HA Long-Lived Token
- **Ingress enabled** - panel appears in sidebar as "API Key"
- **Panel icon** changed to `mdi:key-variant`
- Agent now uses dedicated API key instead of user's HA token
- Agent still uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN internally for HA API operations

### Security
- ✅ No more transmitting HA Long-Lived Token over network
- ✅ API key is independent from HA authentication
- ✅ Can regenerate key without affecting HA access
- ✅ Simpler security model

### Migration
If upgrading from v1.0.8 or earlier:
1. Update add-on to v1.0.9
2. Open Sidebar → API Key (new panel will appear)
3. Copy your new API key
4. Update `~/.cursor/mcp.json` with new key
5. Restart Cursor

Old HA tokens will no longer work (this is intentional for security).
