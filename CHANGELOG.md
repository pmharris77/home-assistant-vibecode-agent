All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.10.2] - 2025-12-06

### ✨ Redesigned Git Versioning & Backup System

**Automatic backup system with AI-powered change descriptions**

The built-in Git versioning and backup system has been completely redesigned. Now, every time you modify scripts, dashboards, and configuration files, the agent automatically saves changes to the onboard Git repository and allows you to easily rollback to any previous version.

**Key improvements:**
- ✅ **AI-generated change descriptions**: The agent now uses AI to create meaningful descriptions of what changed and why (e.g., "Add automation: Control lights when motion detected")
- ✅ **Easy change history**: You can ask AI to show a list of recent changes and quickly find what you need
- ✅ **Smart rollback**: Simply describe what you want to rollback to (e.g., "rollback to when I added the motion sensor automation") and AI will find and restore it

**Bug fix:**
- ✅ **Fixed backup size issue**: Previously, large database or media files could accidentally be included in Git backups, causing rapid repository growth. Now only configuration files, scripts, automations, and dashboards are tracked in Git, keeping backups small and efficient.

## [2.10.1] - 2025-12-06

### 🐛 CRITICAL BUGFIX: Git Backup Size Issue

**Fixed massive backup size increase caused by Git repository including large files**

- ✅ **Automatic `.gitignore` creation**: Git repository now automatically creates `.gitignore` file in `/config` directory to exclude large files
- ✅ **Excluded large files from Git**: Database files (`.db`, `.db-shm`, `.db-wal`), logs, media files, and Home Assistant internal directories are now automatically excluded
- ✅ **Smart file tracking**: Only configuration files (YAML, JSON) are tracked in Git, preventing backup size bloat
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup of tracked files**: When `.gitignore` is created, already tracked large files are automatically removed from Git index (but kept on disk)
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Existing Git repositories are updated with `.gitignore` on next initialization

**What was fixed:**
- Previously, `git add -A` was adding ALL files from `/config`, including:
  - SQLite database files (can be several GB)
  - Log files
  - Media files (`/www/`, `/media/`)
  - Home Assistant internal storage (`.storage/`, `.homeassistant/`)
- This caused backup size to increase from ~1GB to 10-14GB after using the agent
- Now only configuration files are tracked, keeping backup size minimal

**Impact:**
- New installations: Problem completely resolved
- Existing installations: `.gitignore` will be created automatically, and already tracked large files will be removed from Git index, preventing future large files from being added
- Note: Existing Git history may still contain large files - consider cleaning Git history if needed (using `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo`)

**Technical details:**
- `.gitignore` is automatically created/updated when Git repository is initialized
- Excludes: `*.db`, `*.log`, `/www/`, `/media/`, `/.storage/`, `/.homeassistant/`, and other large file patterns
- Git operations now respect `.gitignore`, ensuring only config files are versioned

## [2.10.0] - 2025-12-06

## [2.9.17] - 2025-11-23

### 🐛 BUGFIX: Indentation Error in Helpers Delete Function

- ✅ Fixed IndentationError in `app/api/helpers.py` delete helper function
- ✅ Corrected try-except block indentation
- ✅ Agent should now start correctly

## [2.9.16] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ NEW: Automatic Checkpoint System for Git Versioning

**Consistent checkpoint creation at the start of each user request**

- ✅ Added `create_checkpoint()` method to GitManager - creates commit with tag at request start
- ✅ Added `/api/backup/checkpoint` endpoint for creating checkpoints
- ✅ Added `ha_create_checkpoint` and `ha_end_checkpoint` MCP tools
- ✅ Disabled auto-commits during request processing (prevents micro-commits)
- ✅ Checkpoints include timestamp tag (e.g., `checkpoint_20251123_194530`)
- ✅ Updated all `commit_changes()` calls to skip during request processing
- ✅ Updated AI instructions to automatically create checkpoint at request start
- ✅ Updated MCP package version to 3.2.6

**How it works:**
1. At the start of each user request, `ha_create_checkpoint()` is called
2. Creates a commit with current state (if there are changes)
3. Creates a tag with timestamp and user request description
4. Disables auto-commits during request processing
5. All changes within the request are made without intermediate commits
6. At the end, `ha_end_checkpoint()` re-enables auto-commits

**Benefits:**
- Clean git history - one checkpoint per user request instead of many micro-commits
- Easy rollback - each checkpoint is tagged with timestamp and description
- Better organization - each user request is a logical unit in git history

**Example:**
```
User: "Create nice_dark theme"
→ ha_create_checkpoint("Create nice_dark theme")
→ Creates tag: checkpoint_20251123_194530
→ Makes all changes (no intermediate commits)
→ ha_end_checkpoint()
```

## [2.9.15] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ NEW: Theme Management API & MCP Tools

**Complete theme management functionality for Home Assistant**

- ✅ Added `/api/themes` endpoints: list, get, create, update, delete, reload, check_config
- ✅ Added theme management methods to HA client
- ✅ Added 7 MCP tools for theme management:
  - `ha_list_themes` - List all available themes
  - `ha_get_theme` - Get theme content and configuration
  - `ha_create_theme` - Create a new theme
  - `ha_update_theme` - Update an existing theme
  - `ha_delete_theme` - Delete a theme
  - `ha_reload_themes` - Reload themes in Home Assistant
  - `ha_check_theme_config` - Check if themes are configured
- ✅ Updated MCP package version to 3.2.5

**Use Cases:**
- Create custom themes with CSS variables
- Manage themes programmatically via AI
- Check theme configuration status
- Reload themes without restarting HA

**Example:**
```yaml
nice_dark:
  primary-color: "#ffb74d"
  accent-color: "#ffb74d"
  primary-background-color: "#101018"
  card-background-color: "#181824"
  ha-card-border-radius: "18px"
  ...
```

## [2.9.14] - 2025-11-23

### 🐛 FIX: Entity Rename via WebSocket API

**Fixed 404 error when renaming entities**

- ✅ Changed entity rename from REST API to WebSocket API (`config/entity_registry/update`)
- ✅ Added support for optional `new_name` parameter to update friendly name
- ✅ Fixed "404 Not Found" error when renaming entities

**Technical Details:**
- Home Assistant Entity Registry updates must be done via WebSocket API, not REST
- REST endpoint `/api/config/entity_registry/update/{entity_id}` doesn't exist
- WebSocket command `config/entity_registry/update` is the correct method

## [2.9.13] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ NEW: Entity Rename Functionality

- ✅ Added `/api/entities/rename` endpoint to rename entity_id via Entity Registry API
- ✅ Added `renameEntity` method to HA client
- ✅ Added `ha_rename_entity` MCP tool for renaming entities through AI
- ✅ Updated MCP package version to 3.2.4

**Use Cases:**
- Rename entities to more descriptive names (e.g., `climate.sonoff_trvzb_thermostat` → `climate.office_trv_thermostat`)
- Standardize entity naming conventions across Home Assistant
- Automate entity renaming workflows

## [2.9.12] - 2025-11-21

### ✨ NEW: Logbook API & MCP Tool

- ✅ Added `/api/logbook` endpoint with rich filtering (time window, domains, entities, event types, search)
- ✅ Added summary statistics for scripts/automations to quickly inspect recent runs
- ✅ Updated MCP client, handlers, and tool schema with `ha_logbook_entries`
- ✅ Documented new capability and expanded HA agent test suite to cover logbook operations

## [2.9.11] - 2025-11-18

### 🐛 FIX: Entity Registry Result Format Handling

**Handle both wrapped and direct entity registry result formats**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed parsing of entity registry result - API can return data directly or wrapped in `{'result': ...}`
- ✅ Code now handles both formats correctly
- ✅ Allows deletion to proceed for all helpers

**Technical Details:**
- WebSocket API `config/entity_registry/get` can return data in two formats:
  - Wrapped: `{'result': {...}}`
  - Direct: `{...}`
- Code now checks for both formats and extracts entry data correctly

## [2.9.10] - 2025-11-18

### 🐛 FIX: Syntax Error in Entity Registry Deletion

**Fixed try-except block indentation**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Fixed syntax error: `except` block was incorrectly nested inside `if state:` block
- ✅ Moved `except` to correct level to match `try` block
- ✅ Code now compiles correctly

## [2.9.9] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Comprehensive Helper Deletion Strategy

**Delete helpers from all possible locations: YAML, config entry, and entity registry**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Always check and delete from YAML first (if helper exists there)
- ✅ Then try config entry deletion (for storage helpers)
- ✅ Then try entity registry deletion via WebSocket (even if YAML deletion succeeded)
- ✅ This ensures we delete everywhere possible, including restored entities
- ✅ Better logging to show which methods were used

**Technical Details:**
- YAML deletion: removes from YAML file and reloads integration
- Config entry deletion: finds and deletes config entry for storage helpers
- Entity registry deletion: removes from entity registry via WebSocket (works for all helpers)
- For restored entities: deletion from entity registry may work temporarily even after YAML removal

## [2.9.8] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: WebSocket Deletion for All Helpers

**Attempt WebSocket deletion for all helpers, not just storage helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Try entity registry removal via WebSocket for all helpers (YAML-managed and storage)
- ✅ YAML-managed helpers may be deleted temporarily (will restore on restart if still in YAML)
- ✅ Storage helpers will be permanently deleted
- ✅ Better logging to distinguish between YAML-managed and storage helpers
- ✅ Clear warnings when YAML-managed helpers are deleted (may restore)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `config/entity_registry/remove` WebSocket API for all helpers
- YAML-managed helpers: deletion may work temporarily but will restore if still in YAML
- Storage helpers: permanent deletion via entity registry

## [2.9.7] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 FIX: YAML-Managed Helper Deletion Detection

**Properly detect and handle YAML-managed helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Check if helper is YAML-managed (config_entry_id = None in entity registry)
- ✅ Return clear error message for YAML-managed helpers (cannot be deleted via API)
- ✅ Only attempt entity registry deletion for storage helpers (created via UI)
- ✅ Better error messages explaining that YAML helpers must be removed from YAML files

**Technical Details:**
- YAML-managed helpers have `config_entry_id = None` in entity registry
- These helpers cannot be deleted via API - they must be removed from YAML and HA restarted
- Storage helpers (created via UI) can be deleted via `config/entity_registry/remove`

## [2.9.6] - 2025-11-18

### 🐛 DEBUG: Enhanced Entity Registry Deletion Logging

**Added detailed logging for entity registry deletion debugging**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added debug logging for entity registry get/remove operations
- ✅ Better error messages with exception details
- ✅ Logs registry entry data and API responses

## [2.9.5] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion for Restored Entities

**Added support for deleting restored helpers via entity registry**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added entity registry deletion for restored entities
- ✅ Handles helpers with `restored: true` attribute
- ✅ Uses `config/entity_registry/remove` API for cleanup
- ✅ Supports deletion of helpers that were removed from config but still exist in database

**Use Cases:**
- Delete helpers that were removed from YAML but restored by Home Assistant
- Clean up orphaned entities from entity registry
- Complete cleanup of obsolete helpers

## [2.9.4] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion Logic

**Enhanced config entry deletion with multiple matching strategies**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Improved config entry search with multiple matching strategies:
  - Match by title (common for UI-created helpers)
  - Match by entity_id in options
  - Match by entry details (deep search)
- ✅ Added debug logging for config entry search process
- ✅ Better error messages when helper exists but can't be deleted
- ✅ More robust handling of config-entry-based helpers

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `config/config_entries/get` API to get detailed entry information
- Tries multiple matching strategies before giving up
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

## [2.9.3] - 2025-11-18

### 🔧 IMPROVED: Helper Deletion

**Enhanced helper deletion to support config entry helpers**

**Changes:**
- ✅ `DELETE /api/helpers/delete/{entity_id}` now attempts to delete helpers created via UI/API (config entries)
- ✅ First tries YAML deletion (if helper exists in YAML)
- ✅ Then tries config entry deletion (if helper was created via UI/API)
- ✅ Better error messages when helper cannot be deleted automatically

**Use Cases:**
- Delete helpers created via `ha_create_helper` MCP tool
- Delete helpers created manually via Home Assistant UI
- Clean up obsolete helpers from configuration

## [2.9.2] - 2025-11-18

### ✨ NEW: Service Call API Endpoint

**Added API endpoint for calling Home Assistant services**

**New Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/entities/call_service` - Call any Home Assistant service

**Features:**
- ✅ Call any Home Assistant service via REST API
- ✅ Support for service_data and target parameters
- ✅ Proper parameter merging (target fields merged into service_data)
- ✅ Full error handling and logging

**Parameters:**
- `domain` (required) - Service domain (e.g., "number", "light", "climate")
- `service` (required) - Service name (e.g., "set_value", "turn_on", "set_temperature")
- `service_data` (optional) - Service-specific data
- `target` (optional) - Target entity/entities

**Examples:**
```json
// Set number value
{
  "domain": "number",
  "service": "set_value",
  "service_data": {
    "entity_id": "number.alex_trv_local_temperature_offset",
    "value": -2.0
  }
}

// Turn on light
{
  "domain": "light",
  "service": "turn_on",
  "target": {"entity_id": "light.living_room"}
}

// Set climate temperature
{
  "domain": "climate",
  "service": "set_temperature",
  "target": {"entity_id": "climate.bedroom_trv_thermostat"},
  "service_data": {"temperature": 21.0}
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Configure device parameters (TRV offsets, limits, etc.)
- Control devices (lights, switches, climate)
- Update helper values
- Any Home Assistant service call

**Integration:**
- Used by MCP tool `ha_call_service`
- Enables AI to call services directly
- Full integration with existing ha_client.call_service method

## [2.9.1] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 FIX: Separate YAML files for each helper type

**Problem in v2.9.0:**
- All helper domains (input_boolean, input_text, etc.) referenced same file `helpers.yaml`
- This caused conflicts - each domain tried to load entire file
- Helpers not appearing after reload

**Solution:**
- Each domain now has its own file:
  - `input_boolean.yaml`
  - `input_text.yaml`
  - `input_number.yaml`
  - `input_datetime.yaml`
  - `input_select.yaml`
- Clean configuration.yaml references:
  ```yaml
  input_boolean: !include input_boolean.yaml
  input_text: !include input_text.yaml
  # ... etc
  ```

**Now helpers ACTUALLY work!** 🎉

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-11

### 🎉 MAJOR: Helper Creation via YAML Now Works!

**Breaking Discovery:** Helpers CAN be created via API using YAML + reload method!

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Write helper config to `helpers.yaml`
- ✅ Automatically include `helpers.yaml` in `configuration.yaml`
- ✅ Call `input_*.reload` service to apply changes
- ✅ Helper appears immediately without HA restart

**New Method:**
```python
# 1. Add to helpers.yaml:
input_boolean:
  my_switch:
    name: "My Switch"
    icon: "mdi:toggle-switch"

# 2. Reload integration:
await ws_client.call_service('input_boolean', 'reload', {})

# 3. Helper is now available!
```

**API Changes:**
- ✅ `POST /api/helpers/create` - NOW WORKS via YAML method
- ✅ `DELETE /api/helpers/delete/{entity_id}` - NOW WORKS via YAML method
- ✅ Automatic entity_id generation from name
- ✅ Git commits for all helper changes
- ✅ Validation and error handling

**What Changed:**
- Moved from `.storage/` approach (doesn't work) to YAML approach (works!)
- Helpers created via API are now YAML-based (editable in UI and files)
- Full CRUD support for all helper types

**Credit:** Solution discovered via Home Assistant Community forums

## [2.7.7] - 2025-11-11

### 🚨 Critical: Added Explicit Ban on `attribute:` in Conditional Cards

**MAJOR UPDATE: Found and fixed critical mistake pattern in AI instructions**

**The Problem:**
AI was generating invalid conditional cards with `attribute:` key:
```yaml
# ❌ This was being generated (DOES NOT WORK!)
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: climate.office_trv
    attribute: hvac_action    # ← Lovelace does NOT support this!
    state: heating
```

**Root Cause:**
- Lovelace conditional cards do NOT support `attribute:` key
- Home Assistant automations DO support `attribute:` (confusion!)
- AI instructions didn't explicitly forbid this pattern

**What Was Added:**

1. **🚨 CRITICAL warning section** at document start
2. **Expanded Mistake #4** with multiple wrong examples
3. **Updated Golden Rules** - moved `attribute:` ban to #1
4. **Explanation of automation vs dashboard syntax difference**

**New Structure:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Use template sensor
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Office TRV HVAC Action"
        state: "{{ state_attr('climate.xxx', 'hvac_action') }}"

# Then in dashboard:
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: sensor.office_trv_hvac_action
    state: heating
```

**Impact:**
- AI will never use `attribute:` in Lovelace conditionals
- Clear explanation why (automation vs dashboard difference)
- Template sensor pattern shown as solution
- Fixed actual broken dashboard in Home Assistant (commit 3bee434b)

**Files Updated:**
- `06_conditional_cards.md` - Added explicit ban and examples
- Home Assistant `heating-now.yaml` - Fixed all 7 TRV conditionals

**Version:** 2.7.7 (PATCH - critical documentation fix)

## [2.7.6] - 2025-11-11

### 🐛 Fix: Conditional Cards Guide - Corrected Structure

**Fixed incorrect conditional card patterns in AI instructions**

**What was wrong in v2.7.5:**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Missing "condition: state"
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: climate.office_trv
    state: "heat"
```

**Corrected in v2.7.6:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Must include "condition: state"
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity: sensor.office_trv_hvac_action
    state: heating
```

**Key fixes:**
1. ✅ Added `condition: state` requirement (most common mistake!)
2. ✅ Corrected to use template sensors for hvac_action attributes
3. ✅ Fixed state value: `heating` not "heat"
4. ✅ Added `condition: numeric_state` for numeric comparisons
5. ✅ Updated all examples with correct structure
6. ✅ Based on actual working commit: e8ed8a3b

**Reference:** Commit e8ed8a3b - "Before deleting dashboard: heating-now.yaml" (the working version)

**Impact:**
- AI will now generate correct conditional cards
- Prevents common YAML structure mistakes
- Template sensors properly documented
- Real-world tested patterns

**Version:** 2.7.6 (PATCH - documentation fix)

## [2.7.4] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Git Rollback Endpoint

**Fixed 404 error when rolling back via MCP tools**

**Bug:**
- MCP calls: `POST /api/backup/rollback/{commit_hash}` (path param)
- API expected: `POST /api/backup/rollback` + body
- Result: 404 Not Found

**Fix:**
- Added path parameter endpoint: `/rollback/{commit_hash}`
- Kept body parameter endpoint for compatibility
- Both versions now work

**API Endpoints:**
```
✅ POST /api/backup/rollback/abc123 (path param - for MCP)
✅ POST /api/backup/rollback + body (legacy - for direct API calls)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Git rollback works from AI
- ✅ Can restore previous configurations
- ✅ Both calling styles supported

**Version:** 2.7.4 (PATCH - bug fix)

## [2.7.3] - 2025-11-10

### ✨ Feature: Dashboard Validation + Detailed Errors

**Comprehensive dashboard validation and better error reporting!**

**Part 1: Dashboard Filename Validation**
- Validates filename contains hyphen (HA requirement)
- Checks for spaces, uppercase
- Returns helpful suggestions
- Prevents common mistakes

**Validation Rules:**
```
❌ BAD:  "heating", "stat", "climate" (no hyphen)
✅ GOOD: "heating-now", "climate-control"

Auto-suggestions:
"stat" → "stat-dashboard"
"Heating Now" → "heating-now" (kebab-case)
```

**Part 2: Pre-Creation Checks**
- AI checks if dashboard already exists
- Warns before overwriting
- Validates filename before backup (fail fast)

**Part 3: Detailed Configuration Errors**
- check_config returns detailed errors like Developer Tools
- Shows line numbers and specific issues
- Extracts error messages from HA API
- Much better debugging

**AI Instructions Updated:**
- Added STEP 0: Pre-Creation Checks (mandatory)
- Dashboard name validation rules
- Examples and auto-conversion logic

**Before:**
```
Error: "Configuration has errors: 500 Server Error"
```

**After:**
```
Error: "Configuration invalid!

Invalid config for 'lovelace' at configuration.yaml, line 342: 
Url path needs to contain a hyphen (-) for dictionary value..."
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prevents invalid dashboard names
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ AI can understand and fix issues
- ✅ Fewer failed dashboard creations

**Version:** 2.7.3 (PATCH - validation improvements)

## [2.7.2] - 2025-11-10

### 🐛 Bug Fix: File List Root Directory

**Fixed 500 error when listing files with directory='/'**

**Bug:**
- `ha_list_files` with directory="/" failed
- Error: "Path outside config directory: /"
- AI couldn't browse config directory

**Root Cause:**
- _get_full_path() treated "/" as absolute path
- Security check failed

**Fix:**
- Handle "/" and "" as root config directory
- Strip leading slashes from paths
- Return config_path directly for root

**Impact:**
- ✅ AI can now browse config directory
- ✅ ha_list_files works correctly
- ✅ Security still enforced

**Version:** 2.7.2 (PATCH - bug fix)

## [2.7.1] - 2025-11-10

## [2.3.14] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Repository Parsing Logic (Complete Fix):**
- ✅ Fixed parsing error for all Supervisor API response formats
- ✅ Handles 4 different response formats correctly
- ✅ No more `'list' object has no attribute 'get'` errors

**Root cause found:**
- Supervisor API returns: `{'data': [...list...]}`
- Old code: `result.get('data', {}).get('repositories')`
- If `data` is list: `[...].get('repositories')` → ERROR!

**Complete fix - handles all formats:**
1. Direct list: `[...]`
2. Dict with repositories: `{'repositories': [...]}`
3. Dict with data as list: `{'data': [...]}`
4. Dict with nested data: `{'data': {'repositories': [...]}}`

**Impact:**
- Repository management now fully functional
- All Supervisor API response formats handled correctly

## [2.3.13] - 2025-11-09

**Benefits:**
- See which MCP version is connecting
- Identify version mismatches
- Better debugging capabilities

## [2.3.12] - 2025-11-09

### 🔧 Maintenance

**Force Docker rebuild:**
- Version increment to trigger Home Assistant rebuild
- Ensures repository parsing fix is applied

## [2.3.11] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Repository List Parsing:**
- ✅ Fixed parsing error: `'list' object has no attribute 'get'`
- ✅ Added flexible parsing for Supervisor API response
- ✅ Handles both list and dict response formats

**What was wrong:**
- Code assumed: `result.get('data', {}).get('repositories', [])`
- Supervisor API may return list directly or in different structure
- Caused error when listing repositories

**Fix:**
- Check if result is list → use directly
- Check if result is dict → handle multiple formats
- Fallback to empty list if unexpected format

**Impact:**
- `/api/addons/repositories` now works correctly
- AI can check connected repositories
- AI can suggest adding community repositories

**Changes:**
- app/api/addons.py: flexible parsing in list_repositories()

## [2.3.10] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Fixed Installed Add-ons Detection Logic:**
- ✅ Changed detection from `a.get('installed')` to `a.get('version')`
- ✅ Supervisor API returns `version` field for installed add-ons
- ✅ Field `installed` is not always present in response

**What was wrong:**
- Logic checked for `installed` field: `if a.get('installed')`
- Supervisor API doesn't always include this field
- Installed add-ons have `version` field (current installed version)
- Available (not installed) add-ons only have `version_latest`

**Impact:**
- `/api/addons/available` now correctly separates installed vs available
- `/api/addons/installed` now shows actual installed add-ons
- AI can see which add-ons are already installed

**Changes:**
- app/api/addons.py: changed filter logic in both endpoints
  - `list_available_addons()`: uses `version` to detect installed
  - `list_installed_addons()`: uses `version` to detect installed

## [2.3.9] - 2025-11-09

### 📚 Enhanced AI Instructions

**Improved Add-on Management Guidance:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive add-on reference guide with purpose and use cases
- ✅ Explained why popular add-ons may not appear (minimal repository setup)
- ✅ Removed hardcoded slugs - now dynamically searches add-ons by name
- ✅ Added instructions for users to add community repositories
- ✅ Detailed descriptions of popular add-ons:
  - Mosquitto MQTT Broker (IoT communication)
  - Zigbee2MQTT (Zigbee devices)
  - Node-RED (visual automation)
  - ESPHome (DIY devices)
  - Terminal & SSH (system access)
  - MariaDB (database)
  - DuckDNS/Let's Encrypt (remote access)

**New Use Cases:**
- "What add-ons do you recommend?" - AI suggests based on user needs
- "Why do I see so few add-ons?" - AI explains minimal installation
- Dynamic slug discovery instead of hardcoded values

**Impact:**
- AI can now provide intelligent recommendations
- Users understand why certain add-ons aren't visible
- Better guidance for repository management
- Safer installations (no hardcoded slugs that may be wrong)

**Changes:**
- app/api/ai_instructions.py: 2.3.0 → 2.3.9
- Added 📋 Popular Add-ons Reference
- Added 🎯 Use Case templates
- Added ⚠️ Repository requirements explanation

## [2.3.8] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Fixed Supervisor API URL Path Duplication:**
- ✅ Removed `/supervisor/` prefix from all endpoint paths
- ✅ Fixed URL from `http://supervisor/supervisor/addons` to `http://supervisor/addons`
- ✅ All add-on management endpoints now use correct URL format

**Root cause:**
- v2.3.4 added `/supervisor/` prefix to endpoints
- But `base_url` is already `http://supervisor`
- Result: `http://supervisor` + `/supervisor/addons` = double `/supervisor/` → 404

**Fixed all endpoints:**
- `addons` (not `supervisor/addons`)
- `addons/{slug}/info`, `/logs`, `/install`, `/uninstall`, etc.
- `store/repositories` (not `supervisor/store/repositories`)

**Impact:**
- 🎉 Add-on management should now work with correct URLs!
- Manager role from v2.3.7 + correct URLs = working add-on management

## [2.3.7] - 2025-11-09

### 🔐 Critical Fix: Supervisor API Access + Security

**1. Added Supervisor Manager Role (Critical):**
- ✅ Added `hassio_role: manager` to config.yaml
- ✅ Grants add-on permissions to manage other add-ons via Supervisor API
- ✅ Fixes 403 Forbidden errors for all add-on management operations

**Root cause of 403 errors:**
- Supervisor API requires `hassio_role: manager` for add-on management
- Without this role, all Supervisor API calls return 403 Forbidden
- `hassio_api: true` alone is not sufficient for add-on management

**2. Security Fix: Removed Token Logging:**
- ✅ Removed token preview from all logs
- ✅ Changed from `Token: 7e2dec72...` to no token logging
- ✅ Headers logging moved to DEBUG level

**Why:**
- Logging tokens (even preview) is a security risk
- Tokens should never appear in logs accessible to users
- Debug-level logging available if needed for troubleshooting

**Changes:**
- config.yaml: added `hassio_role: manager`
- app/main.py: removed token from SupervisorClient startup log
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: removed token from all logs

**Impact:**
- 🎉 Add-on management should now work correctly!
- 🔐 No token information in logs (improved security)

## [2.3.6] - 2025-11-09

### 🔍 Debug Enhancement

**Enhanced Supervisor API Logging:**
- ✅ Added detailed logging for Supervisor API requests
- ✅ Log exact URL, headers, and token (preview) for each request
- ✅ Added SupervisorClient initialization log in startup event

**Purpose:**
- Debug 403 Forbidden errors from Supervisor API
- Verify correct URL format and authentication headers
- Identify root cause of add-on management issues

**Changes:**
- app/main.py: added SupervisorClient logging in startup event
- app/services/supervisor_client.py: enhanced request logging (INFO level)
- Logs now show: URL, headers, token preview for debugging

## [2.3.5] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**1. Supervisor API Authentication Fix (Critical):**
- ✅ Fixed authentication header for Supervisor API
- ✅ Changed from `Authorization: Bearer {token}` to `X-Supervisor-Token: {token}`
- ✅ All add-on management operations now authenticate correctly

**What was wrong:**
- Supervisor API uses custom `X-Supervisor-Token` header, not standard `Authorization: Bearer`
- All requests were rejected with 403 Forbidden due to incorrect auth header
- Home Assistant Supervisor API documentation specifies `X-Supervisor-Token` format

**Impact:**
- All add-on management endpoints now work correctly ✅
- Authentication passes, full add-on lifecycle management functional
- Fixes 403 Forbidden errors from v2.3.4

**2. Logs Endpoint Redirect Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed unnecessary 307 redirect for `/api/logs` endpoint
- ✅ Changed `@router.get("/")` to `@router.get("")` in logs.py
- ✅ Direct response without redirect

**What was wrong:**
- Endpoint was defined as `/api/logs/` (with trailing slash)
- Requests to `/api/logs` caused 307 redirect to `/api/logs/`
- FastAPI automatically redirects when trailing slash mismatch occurs

**Impact:**
- `/api/logs` now responds directly with 200 OK (no redirect)
- Improved API performance and cleaner request logs

## [2.3.4] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Supervisor API Endpoint Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed all Supervisor API endpoints to use correct `/supervisor/` prefix
- ✅ Changed from `http://supervisor/addons` to `http://supervisor/supervisor/addons`
- ✅ All add-on management operations now work correctly

**What was wrong:**
- All endpoints were missing the `/supervisor/` prefix
- Resulted in 403 Forbidden errors from Supervisor API
- Supervisor API requires: `http://supervisor/supervisor/{endpoint}`

**Fixed endpoints:**
- ✅ `supervisor/addons` (list all)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/info` (get info)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/logs` (get logs)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/install` (install)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/uninstall` (uninstall)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/start` (start)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/stop` (stop)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/restart` (restart)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/update` (update)
- ✅ `supervisor/addons/{slug}/options` (configure)
- ✅ `supervisor/store/repositories` (repositories)

**Impact:**
- All add-on management endpoints now return correct data instead of 403 errors
- Full add-on lifecycle management now functional ✅

## [2.3.3] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Router Prefix Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate `/api/addons` prefix in `addons.py`
- ✅ Changed `router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/addons", ...)` to `router = APIRouter()`
- ✅ All add-on management endpoints now work correctly

**What was wrong:**
- Prefix was defined both in `addons.py` AND `main.py`
- URLs became `/api/addons/api/addons/installed` → 404
- Other routers (files, hacs) correctly use no prefix in router definition

**Impact:**
- Fixes all add-on management endpoints returning 404
- `/api/addons/installed` now correctly maps to `/api/addons/installed` ✅

## [2.3.2] - 2025-11-09

### 🔧 Build Fix

**Force Docker Rebuild:**
- ✅ Added version comment to `Dockerfile` to break Docker cache
- ✅ Ensures all new files (addons.py, supervisor_client.py) are included in build
- ✅ Fixes 404 error for add-on management endpoints

**Why this fix:**
- Home Assistant was using cached Docker image from v2.3.0
- New files weren't being copied into the container
- Cache-busting comment forces full rebuild

## [2.3.1] - 2025-11-09

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Critical Import Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed ImportError in `app/api/addons.py`
- ✅ Changed `from app.models import Response` to `from app.models.schemas import Response`
- ✅ Agent now starts correctly

**Impact:**
- Fixes agent startup failure in v2.3.0
- All add-on management features now work correctly

  - Aligned with Step 2 instructions (Settings → Tools & MCP)

## [1.0.17] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- **Documentation correction** - Ingress Panel access path
  - Correct: Settings → Add-ons → HA Cursor Agent → "Open Web UI"
  - Incorrect (removed): "Sidebar → 🔑 API Key" (this doesn't exist)
- **All documentation updated** with correct path to Web UI

## [1.0.16] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Updated setup instructions** - now use Cursor Settings UI instead of manual file editing
  - Primary method: Settings → Tools & MCP → New MCP Server → Add Custom MCP Server
  - Manual file editing as alternative (for advanced users)
  - Clearer, more user-friendly workflow
  - Aligned with official Cursor MCP setup process

## [1.0.15] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- **Clipboard API error** - fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeText')"
  - Added fallback to legacy `document.execCommand('copy')` method
  - Works in non-HTTPS contexts (Home Assistant Ingress)
  - Graceful error handling with manual copy instructions
  - Copy button now works reliably in all browsers

### Technical
- Implemented smart clipboard detection: tries modern API → falls back to legacy
- Better error messages if both methods fail

## [1.0.14] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Consistent naming:** "API Key" → "Agent Key" throughout UI
  - Better alignment with `HA_AGENT_KEY` variable name
  - Clearer distinction from Home Assistant tokens
- **Simplified security info:** Removed technical details about SUPERVISOR_TOKEN
  - Less confusing for end users
  - Focused on what matters: "Agent Key authenticates you"

## [1.0.13] - 2025-11-08

### Improved
- **Copy button feedback** - better visual confirmation when copying
  - Button changes to "✅ Copied!" for 2 seconds
  - Button pulses on click
  - Center popup notification
  - Clear success/error states

### Fixed
- Copy button now has clear visual feedback (was not obvious before)

## [1.0.12] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Improved Ingress Panel UX** - complete redesign focused on user workflow
  - **Primary focus:** Ready-to-use JSON configuration (copy entire config)
  - **One-click copy:** "Copy Configuration to Clipboard" button
  - **Clear steps:** Step-by-step instructions for Cursor setup
  - **Advanced section:** API key view/regenerate moved to collapsed section
  - **Better flow:** User copies JSON → pastes → restarts Cursor → done!

### Added
- New `ingress_panel.py` module for cleaner HTML template management
- Advanced section with key visibility toggle
- Regenerate key button (UI prepared, backend TBD)

### UX Improvements
- No need to manually construct JSON - it's ready to copy
- Masked key by default in advanced section
- Clear visual hierarchy (config first, key details later)

## [1.0.11] - 2025-11-08

### Changed
- **Renamed environment variable** - `HA_TOKEN` → `HA_AGENT_KEY` (more accurate naming)
- **Backward compatible** - agent still accepts old `HA_TOKEN` name
- **Updated all documentation** - shows `HA_AGENT_KEY` in examples
- **Updated Ingress Panel** - displays `HA_AGENT_KEY` in setup instructions
- **Updated MCP client** - accepts both `HA_AGENT_KEY` and `HA_TOKEN`

### Migration
- **Recommended:** Update `~/.cursor/mcp.json` to use `HA_AGENT_KEY` instead of `HA_TOKEN`
- **Optional:** Old `HA_TOKEN` still works for backward compatibility

## [1.0.10] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed
- **Notification logic** - moved into get_or_generate_api_key() function
- Removed problematic `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator
- Fixed async context for notification sending
- Application now starts correctly with notification feature enabled

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-08

### 🔒 Security & UX Improvements

**Breaking Change:** API authentication changed from Home Assistant Long-Lived Token to dedicated API Key.

### Added
- **Dedicated API Key system** - separate from HA tokens
  - Auto-generates secure API key (32 bytes, cryptographically secure)
  - Optional: set custom API key in add-on configuration
  - Stored in `/config/.ha_cursor_agent_key`
- **Ingress Panel** - beautiful web UI in Home Assistant sidebar
  - Shows current API key (masked by default, click to reveal)
  - Copy to clipboard button
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Direct links to documentation
- **Optional notifications** - get notified when API key is generated
  - Configurable in add-on settings

### Changed
- **Authentication simplified** - no need to create HA Long-Lived Token
- **Ingress enabled** - panel appears in sidebar as "API Key"
- **Panel icon** changed to `mdi:key-variant`
- Agent now uses dedicated API key instead of user's HA token
- Agent still uses SUPERVISOR_TOKEN internally for HA API operations

### Security
- ✅ No more transmitting HA Long-Lived Token over network
- ✅ API key is independent from HA authentication
- ✅ Can regenerate key without affecting HA access
- ✅ Simpler security model

### Migration
If upgrading from v1.0.8 or earlier:
1. Update add-on to v1.0.9
2. Open Sidebar → API Key (new panel will appear)
3. Copy your new API key
4. Update `~/.cursor/mcp.json` with new key
5. Restart Cursor

Old HA tokens will no longer work (this is intentional for security).
